# PM2.5-Nonattainment
This repository contains file for constructing and analyzing data sets used in the paper "An empirical evaluation of the causal impact of NAAQS nonattainment designations on particulate pollution and health" by Zigler, Choirat, and Dominici

Supporting data files can be obtained at: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/pm97naaqs
The scripts contained herein also require the following R packages:
1) AREPA, https://github.com/czigler/arepa
2) HEIfunctions, 

# -- IMPORTANT NOTE -- #
Note that the actual analysis in the paper relies on Medicare data that cannot be shared.  The data available on the Dataverse contain fake, simulated health data from Medicare.  Thus, these files will not reproduce the exact data and results reported in the paper, but rather represent the form of the analysis should anyone be interested in following the same procedure with different data sources.
